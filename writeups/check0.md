Checkpoint 0 Writeup
====================

My name: Muhammad Waleed

My SUNet ID: l226824

I collaborated with: l226824

I would like to credit/thank these classmates for their help: l226824

This lab took me about [17] hours to do. I did not attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 919440

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: CN is not soo boring afterall.

Describe ByteStream implementation. Hahhh where should i start...
I tried soo many things to reduce complexity.
I started with vectors but for some reason they had bad time complexity so my codes failed the time limits + many many illegal access errors.
Then i shifted to queues due to their contant time push and pop but was heart broken to find that the peek function was const which was a issue for me.
Soo i shifted to strings there i spent a lot of time but was of no good use.
Remember the issue with peek yea i found out it can be solved usong mutbale keyword.
Anyhow i being tired then again went back to vectors and this time for some unholy reason they worked.
I have taken screenshort of passed test cases soo if they failed on evaluationday i am not responsible. This code is cursed for real.
Thanks for reading.

alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: finding why my test cases were failing. 
          Yea. Still dont know why they passed too. 

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: giving an overview of syntaxes.
          Agreed. Because going on internet ourself feels like cheating so it would be nice to know allowed resources given by you guys.

- Optional: I'm not sure about: why my code fails test case of webget on vector but passes on using string even though the output is same.
            No idea mate. I am some other person after completing byte streat code. That man is long gone for good.

- Optional: I contributed a new test case that catches a plausible bug
  not otherwise caught: [provide Pull Request URL]
            haha
